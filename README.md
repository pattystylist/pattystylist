---I used to be assistant lab manager at FABLAB/Baltimore.  I currently work as a costume designer in nyc.>
I really missed being at the lab and making stuff, so I set up a small makerspace in my apt.
After FABLAB, I'm finding my desktop machines, meh.
I have a makeblock laser cutter.  Really impressive for the price.  I've barely touched it since fedex guy dropped the pallet in my apartment.  need to recalibrate and trouble
shoot to get it working properly.
I bought the Vaquform desktop-don't know whats going on-not impressed-need to trouble shoot
I have Anycubic MZ 2.0- cannot get software to load
I don't know anything about coding, but would like to learn
I best at Corel draw and laser cutting and engraving.
